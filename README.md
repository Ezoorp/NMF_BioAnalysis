## NMF_BioAnalysis

This is a professional version of the code I used to run nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) on some spatial rna sequence data.
Major steps include:
1. Loading Data
2. Quality Control - Removing low quality data
3. Normalizing Data with Log-Normalization
4. Identifying Highly Variable Genes
5. Running NMF
6. Clustering NMF components
7. Scoring each cell for the NMF components

In the Notebooks/Exploration folder I have some notebooks and scripts I used to explore packages or concepts from other papers.
